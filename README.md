# üõ∞Ô∏è NextEra Energy Drone Optimization Challenge

## üß≠ 1. Problem Overview

NextEra Energy operates autonomous drones to inspect tens of thousands of miles of power lines. The challenge is to **plan efficient drone inspection missions** that cover all required photo waypoints while staying within the battery limit and returning to the depot after each mission.

The objective is to **minimize total cost** (distance/time) while ensuring:

* Every photo waypoint is visited at least once.
* Each mission stays within the **37,725 ft** battery limit.
* All flights remain within the allowed airspace polygon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Our Approach

We began by analyzing the problem and established that it belongs to the class of **NP-hard problems**, meaning that finding an exact optimal solution would require **exponential time (E^E computations)** as the number of waypoints grows.

Our exploration included:

* **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Considered as a heuristic but discarded because it does not ensure valid traversal paths and can lead to suboptimal routing.
* **Google OR-Tools:** Adopted for its efficient heuristics and constraint handling capabilities for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP).
* **Cost Function Optimization:** We experimented with combining **distance** and **time** as cost factors to find better trade-offs and encourage the optimizer to utilize multiple vehicles (missions).

### Pipeline Summary

1. **Data Inspection:** Load and validate datasets (`numpy.load`).
2. **Unconstrained TSP:** Generate an initial route using OR-Tools.
3. **Path Reconstruction:** Decode indirect routes using `predecessors.npy` to ensure polygon adherence.
4. **Mission Segmentation:** Split routes into valid missions under the 37,725 ft battery limit.
5. **Visualization:** Map the planned routes using Plotly/GeoPandas to confirm coverage.
6. **Evaluation:** Compute total distance, mission count, and verify that all photo points were visited.

## üîí 4. Data Confidentiality Notice

We have **not uploaded any of the original data files** (`.npy` and `.wkt` files) provided by NextEra Energy for this challenge, as they contain **sensitive and proprietary information**.
This repository only includes our **code**, **visualizations**, and **methodology** to reproduce the pipeline structure (not the actual dataset).
